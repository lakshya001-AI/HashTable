# HashTable Implementation

This is a simple implementation of a hash table data structure in Python. Hash tables are a fundamental data structure used for efficient data retrieval and storage. This repository provides a basic understanding of how hash tables work and serves as a starting point for further exploration and customization.

## Overview

A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data quickly. It works by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, where the corresponding values are stored. Hash tables offer constant-time (O(1)) average case complexity for key-based operations, making them incredibly efficient for tasks like data caching, indexing, and more.

This repository contains a basic implementation of a hash table using Python's built-in data structures. It includes methods for inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs.

## Usage

To use this hash table implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ``` shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hashtable.git
   ```

2. Import the `HashTable` class into your Python project:

   ```python
   from hashtable import HashTable
   ```

3. Create a new instance of the `HashTable`:

   ```python
   my_table = HashTable()
   ```

4. Use the provided methods to interact with the hash table:

   - Insert key-value pairs:

     ```python
     my_table.insert("key1", "value1")
     my_table.insert("key2", "value2")
     ```

   - Retrieve values by key:

     ```python
     value = my_table.get("key1")
     ```

   - Delete key-value pairs:

     ```python
     my_table.delete("key1")
     ```

   - Check if a key exists:

     ```python
     if my_table.contains("key2"):
         print("Key2 exists in the hash table.")
     ```

   - View the current size of the hash table:

     ```python
     size = my_table.size()
     ```

   - Print the hash table's contents:

     ```python
     my_table.print()
     ```

## Implementation Details

This hash table implementation uses an array to store key-value pairs. It employs a hash function to compute an index for each key, ensuring that keys are distributed evenly across the array. In case of hash collisions (when two keys map to the same index), it uses separate chaining to handle multiple key-value pairs at the same index.

The `HashTable` class in this repository includes methods for inserting, retrieving, deleting, and checking the existence of key-value pairs. The underlying array dynamically resizes to maintain efficient performance.
